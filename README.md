# Chaotic Stream Cipher

A web-based cryptographic tool that implements a stream cipher using a chaotic logistic map. This project was developed as an assignment for an Information Systems Security course.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Chaotic Keystream Generation:** Uses the logistic map (`Xn+1 = Œª * Xn * (1 - Xn)`) to generate a pseudo-random keystream.
-   **Seed-Based Encryption:** All cryptographic parameters (`X‚ÇÄ` and `Œª`) are deterministically derived from a user-provided text seed using SHA-256.
-   **Symmetric Encryption/Decryption:** Employs a standard XOR operation to both encrypt and decrypt text.
-   **Interactive Web Interface:** A user-friendly UI built with Flask and JavaScript to easily perform cryptographic operations.
-   **Detailed Process Visualization:** Provides a step-by-step summary of the entire cryptographic process.
-   **Character Breakdown Table:** Displays a detailed, byte-by-byte table showing how each character is encrypted/decrypted, including proper handling for multi-byte UTF-8 characters.
-   **Dual Byte Representation:** Shows byte values in both hexadecimal and their printable character equivalent (e.g., `0x42 ('B')`) for enhanced readability.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The application follows the classic stream cipher architecture but uses a chaotic function as its Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).

1.  **Seed to Parameters:** The user's text seed is hashed with SHA-256. The resulting hash is used to generate the initial value `X‚ÇÄ` (between 0 and 1) and the control parameter `Œª` (in the chaotic range of 3.9 to 3.9999).
2.  **Keystream Generation:** The logistic map equation is iterated using these parameters to produce a sequence of chaotic floating-point numbers.
3.  **Byte Conversion:** Each number in the sequence is converted into a byte (0-255) to form the final keystream.
4.  **XOR Operation:** The input text (as bytes) is XORed with the keystream to produce the ciphertext. The same process decrypts the ciphertext back to plaintext.
